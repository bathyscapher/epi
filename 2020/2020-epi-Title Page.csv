,"The 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) ranks 180 countries on 32 performance indicators in the following 11 issue categories: air quality, sanitation and drinking water, heavy metals, waste management, biodiversity and habitat, ecosystem services, fisheries, climate change, pollution emissions, agriculture, and water resources. These categories track performance and progress on two broad policy objectives, environmental health and ecosystem vitality. The EPI's proximity-to-target methodology facilitates cross-country comparisons among economic and regional peer groups. The data set includes the 2020 EPI, component scores, and time-series source data. It is the result of a collaboration of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy (YCELP), Yale University, Columbia University Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN), and the World Economic Forum (WEF). The Interactive Website for the 2020 EPI is at https://epi.yale.edu/.",
